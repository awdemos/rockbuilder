# RockBuilder

RockBuilder is a configuration-based build system that simplifies the process of integrating and building one or multiple AI applications on top of AMD’s ROCm SDK. 

[TheRock](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock) provides the official ROCm images, while RockBuilder supports building additional applications on top of the ROCm SDK that are not tightly integrated with TheRock. RockBuilder is mainly targeted at developers and users who want to add support for building or using these additional applications.

> **Note:** RockBuilder currently supports all stable ROCm versions from TheRock where applicable.

RockBuilder can use:

- An existing ROCm SDK installation.

- A new ROCm SDK, either:

    - Built from source, or

    - Installed from Python wheels.

RockBuilder supports both Linux and Windows for building the applications.

>**Note:** Windows support is still less tested compared to Linux. You may encounter issues that haven’t been fully validated yet.

## Download RockBuilder

```
git clone https://github.com/roCm/rockbuilder
```

## Rockbuilder Initialization

Initialize and activate the Python virtual environment with all Python dependencies required by RockBuilder.

- Linux (Ubuntu 24.04):

    ```bash
    cd rockbuilder
    source ./init_rcb_env.sh
    ```

- Windows (x86_64, Visual Studio Command Prompt):

    ```bat
    cd rockbuilder
    init_rcb_env.bat
    ```

On Linux, the script **must be sourced** (`source ./init_rcb_env.sh`), not executed directly.

The `init_rcb_env` script checks whether a Python virtual environment is already active. If not, it creates and activates one in the **`.venv`** directory and installs the packages from `requirements.txt`.

Run `source ./init_rcb_env.sh` again in any new terminal before using RockBuilder.

## Rockbuilder Configuration

Configuration is stored in **`rockbuilder.cfg`** at the RockBuilder root. This file records:

- which ROCm SDK RockBuilder should use (local build, existing install, or Python wheels), and
- which AMD GPU target(s) to build for.

Configuration is separate from initialization. Init sets up Python; config selects the ROCm SDK source and GPU targets.

### Interactive configuration

After the virtual environment is active, run RockBuilder without an application config file:

```bash
python rockbuilder.py --help
```

If `rockbuilder.cfg` does not exist, RockBuilder launches an interactive UI to choose the ROCm SDK source and GPU target(s):

- **New ROCm SDK Build** — build TheRock from source (lists all supported GPUs).

    <img src="docs/pics/readme/cfg_new_build_60pct.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- **ROCm SDK from Python Wheels** — install from nightly wheels (lists GPUs with available packages).

    <img src="docs/pics/readme/cfg_python_wheel_60pct.png" width="100%" height="100%">

Press **Enter** to save selections to `rockbuilder.cfg`.

### Manual configuration (headless / automation)

In non-interactive environments (CI, remote shells, AI agents), create or edit `rockbuilder.cfg` directly instead of using the UI.

**New ROCm SDK build** (TheRock built by RockBuilder), targeting MI210 (`gfx90a`):

```ini
[rocm_sdk]
rocm_sdk_build = ['<rockbuilder-root>/src_apps/therock/build/dist/rocm']

[build_targets]
gpus = ['gfx90a']
```

Replace `<rockbuilder-root>` with the absolute path to your RockBuilder checkout.

**ROCm SDK from Python wheels** (example):

```ini
[rocm_sdk]
rocm_sdk_whl_server = ['https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/']
rocm_sdk_whl_version = 7.13.0a20260501

[build_targets]
gpus = ['gfx90a']
```

**Use an existing ROCm SDK install**:

```ini
[rocm_sdk]
rocm_sdk_home = ['/opt/rocm']

[build_targets]
gpus = ['gfx90a']
```

### Verify configuration

With the virtual environment active and `rockbuilder.cfg` in place:

```bash
python rockbuilder.py --help
```

This should print usage text without launching the configuration UI.

> **Note:** Init and config do **not** build the ROCm SDK. The SDK is built or installed later, when you run RockBuilder to build therock or other applications. A local ROCm SDK build can take one to several hours depending on your system.

## Build an Application Set

In many cases, multiple applications need to be built to achieve full functionality. RockBuilder handles this by listing all related applications and their corresponding versions in an `.apps` file.

Example usage to build PyTorch nightly and its dependencies:

```
./rockbuilder.py apps/pytorch_nightly.apps
```

This will download, configure, and build all applications that are specified in the `pytorch_nightly.apps` file.

```apps/pytorch_nightly.apps
[apps]
app_list=
    deps_common
    pytorch_aotriton_nightly
    triton_pytorch_nightly
    pytorch_nightly
    pytorch_vision_nightly
    pytorch_torchcodec_nightly
    pytorch_audio_nightly
```

Applications are built and installed in the listed order above. Each application will be installed into the currently active Python virtual environment. Any additional libraries or executables built by CMake will be installed to the configured ROCm SDK.

Built Python wheels will be copied to the `packages/wheels` directory in RockBuilder.

## Build Applications One By One

Instead of building a set of applications, you can also build them one by one in the correct dependency order.

```
./rockbuilder.py apps/deps_common.cfg
./rockbuilder.py apps/pytorch_aotriton_nightly.cfg
./rockbuilder.py apps/triton_pytorch_nightly.cfg
./rockbuilder.py apps/pytorch_nightly.cfg
./rockbuilder.py apps/pytorch_vision_nightly.cfg
./rockbuilder.py apps/pytorch_torchcodec_nightly.cfg
./rockbuilder.py apps/pytorch_audio_nightly.cfg
```

Each of these `.cfg` files provides an application-specific configuration. These files define the application name, version, source repository, and the commands required to configure, build, and install the application.

Configuration file format is specified in [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md).

## Test the Applications Build

RockBuilder includes simple example applications to verify that the PyTorch build was successful. If you are running the tests from a new terminal window, you’ll need to activate the Python virtual environment first. If it’s already active, you can skip this step:

```
source ./init_rcb_env.sh 
```

Then, run the example application itself with the following command:

```
python examples/torch_gpu_hello_world.py 
```

If successful, the application should print output similar to the following in the terminal:

```
Pytorch version: 2.8.0
ROCM HIP version: 7.1.25441-b9b1250
cuda device count: 2
default cuda device name: AMD Radeon Pro W7900 Dual Slot
device type: cuda
Tensor training running on cuda: True
Running simple model training test
    tensor([0., 1., 2.], device='cuda:0')
Hello World, test executed succesfully
```

Example output from the test applications on Windows using the AMD Radeon W7900 GPU:

```bash
(.venv) D:\rockbuilder\examples>python torch_gpu_hello_world.py
Pytorch version: 2.7.0
ROCM HIP version: 6.5.25222-1f8e4aaca
cuda device count: 1
default cuda device name: AMD Radeon PRO W7900 Dual Slot
device type: cuda
Tensor training running on cuda: True
Running simple model training test
    tensor([0., 1., 2.], device='cuda:0')
Hello World, test executed succesfully

(.venv) D:\rockbuilder\examples>python torch_vision_hello_world.py
pytorch version: 2.7.0
pytorch vision version: 0.22.0

(.venv) D:\rockbuilder\examples>python torch_audio_hello_world.py
pytorch version: 2.7.0
pytorch audio version: 2.7.0
```

You can also test the flash-attention support in PyTorch with the following example application:

```
python examples/torch_attention_check.py
```

## Other RockBuilder Usage Examples

RockBuilder also supports optional build arguments as follows:

### Checkout Only the Source Code

This command checks out the source code for the PyTorch 2.8–related applications without building them. The source code will be checked out to the `src_apps` directory.

```bash
python rockbuilder.py --checkout apps/pytorch_28_amd.apps
```

### Checkout Source Code to a Custom Directory

This command checks out the source code for each project to the `custom_src_location` directory instead of the default `src_apps` directory.

```bash
python rockbuilder.py --checkout --src-base-dir custom_src_location apps/pytorch_28_amd.apps
```

### Build and Install Python Wheel to a Custom Directory

This command builds and installs only PyTorch Audio and copies the produced PyTorch Audio wheel to the `test` directory instead of the default `packages/wheels` directory.

>**Note:** PyTorch Audio requires PyTorch to be built and installed first.

```bash
python rockbuilder.py apps/pytorch_audio.cfg --output-dir test
```

### Checkout the Source Code of a Single Application to a Custom Directory

This command checks out the source code of a single application to the `src_prj/py_audio` directory.

```bash
python rockbuilder.py --checkout apps/pytorch_audio.cfg --src-dir src_prj/py_audio
```

### Checkout a Custom Version

This command checks out the source code of PyTorch Audio version `2.6.0` instead of the version specified in the `pytorch_audio.cfg` file.

```bash
python rockbuilder.py --checkout pytorch_audio --pytorch_audio-version=v2.6.0
```

### Execute Only the Install Phase

This command executes only the install phase for a previously built PyTorch Audio.

>**Note:** PyTorch Audio requires PyTorch to be built and installed first.

```bash
python rockbuilder.py --install apps/pytorch_audio.cfg
```

## Add a New Application to RockBuilder

RockBuilder uses two types of configuration files stored under the applications directory.

### Application Set Configuration File

`apps/core.apps` is an example of an application set configuration file, listing applications that RockBuilder can build:

```bash
[apps]
app_list=
    pytorch
    pytorch_vision
    pytorch_audio
```

### Application Configuration File

`apps/pytorch.cfg` is an example of an application configuration file, defining the actions that RockBuilder executes for a specific project, including:

- init
- checkout
- clean
- pre-configure
- configure
- post-configure
- build
- install
- post-install

By default the RockBuilder executes init, checkout, pre-configure, configure, post-configure, build, install, and post-install phases for the application. You can override this by specifying the desired command phase. For example:

```bash
python rockbuilder.py --checkout apps/pytorch.cfg
```
